This is an example of how to do value management within the 0xcert Framework v2.

The example is put in the context of a simple dApp to showcase not only functionalities but also the basic principles of handling blockchain communication through the 0xcert Framework. The main logic is isolated in the `src/example.ts` file while response handling is located in `index.ts`. The basic configuration needed for communication can be found in the `src/config.ts` file.

To keep the example as simple as possible, some values are hardcoded, such as the kind of value ledger we are deploying. You can change those values in the `src/example.ts` file.
